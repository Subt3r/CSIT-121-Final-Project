    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>

    <p>
      Throughout this project I was tested in most if not all waspects of this class and the core concepts that were taught.
      Each page reflects what I have learned be it basic html, CSS, being able to use HTML tables, etc. during this final, the most difficult part for me was finding how to fit all of my previous labs into 
      this singular page so that there is not an absurd amount of html files in my final folder. From what I have learned, being able to integrate multiple pages int one cohesive site has taught me how 
      important it is to make sure everything is organized, and set in a way that fits cohesively making the website, easy to navigate, read, and acess.
    </p>

    <p>
      While testing the website on different browsers and mobile devices, I was able to see why it is so important to check multiple devices in the first place.
      Some elements would not show up on one browser and vice versa on another. My website initally didn't run on mobile devices and really helped reinforce the need to have a responsive design when
      making a webpage. Testing taught me to be more mindful with my layout and its flexibility and user experience across different browsers and devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout this course, I gained insight on HTML atructure, CSS styling, accessiblity, and modern design principles like CRAP that I wouldn't have thought to
      implement in such a way. I learned how good web design isn't just about the prettiest website, or one with the most information, good web design cneeds to clearly communicate information and must support all
      users. Through this project and the class as a whole, I was able to connect all of these ideas and put them to use in ways that expand past this class.
