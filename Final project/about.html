    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Toluwanimi, I am 21 years old and this will be my second to last semester at CCBC.
       Throughout my academic journey I have gone through many trials and tribulations that have shaped me as an indiviual.
       Despite whatever troubles may have come with my goal has been the same to create my very own game and this class has pushed me closer to that goal.
       I truly value and appreciate the information that was learned in this class, being ablt to create my own websites and honing this skill further will help me in both
       my academic and personal goals.
